üìä Latest Observations from Logs
The new logs confirm that the live match screen now appears and the timer is updating (no longer stuck on "SCHEDULED"). However, they also show that the SSE client still isn‚Äôt actually connecting:
connectionStatus: "disconnected" throughout the session, indicating the EventSource never established a connection.
The ‚ÄúTest SSE Connection‚Äù button reports ‚ÄúEventSource not available‚Äù, meaning the EventSource API is undefined in the React Native environment
GitHub
.
Despite SSE being unavailable, the timer does progress (the logs show üìä Polling: Timer updated‚Ä¶ messages), which means the polling fallback is successfully driving the timer updates.
In summary: your fallback-heavy solution is working ‚Äì the live screen shows up and the timer runs via polling ‚Äì but the SSE connection itself is still failing to initialize. Let‚Äôs break down what this means for reliability and how to address the remaining SSE issue.
üîß Why ‚ÄúEventSource Not Available‚Äù Is Showing
The message ‚ÄúEventSource not available‚Äù from the test button is a clear indicator that the EventSource polyfill didn‚Äôt load correctly on app startup. In the SSETestButton component, you can see it explicitly checks for typeof EventSource and sets that status if undefined
GitHub
. Your current integration of the polyfill is likely the culprit:
In setupEventSourcePolyfill(), the code uses require('react-native-event-source').EventSource and assigns it to global.EventSource
GitHub
. However, the react-native-event-source library exports the EventSource class as the default export, not as a named EventSource property. This means require('react-native-event-source') already returns the constructor function. Accessing .EventSource on it will be undefined, so global.EventSource was unintentionally set to undefined. No exception was thrown, so it logged a ‚Äú‚úÖ polyfill loaded‚Äù message even though nothing was actually loaded.
The correct usage (as noted in the SSE migration guide) is to import the module and assign it directly, without ‚Äú.EventSource‚Äù. For example:
typescript
Copy
import RNEventSource from 'react-native-event-source';
global.EventSource = RNEventSource;
This is exactly what the guide recommends in App.tsx
GitHub
. If using require, it should be:
js
Copy
const RNEventSource = require('react-native-event-source');
global.EventSource = RNEventSource.default || RNEventSource;
(The extra .default check covers both CommonJS and ES module formats.)
Bottom line: Fixing the polyfill initialization should make EventSource available globally. Once that‚Äôs done, clicking ‚ÄúTest SSE Connection‚Äù should show a successful connection (or at least progress beyond the ‚Äúnot available‚Äù state), and your useMatchTimer hook will actually attempt the SSE connection with a valid EventSource constructor.
‚úÖ Reliability of the Current Polling-First Solution
Even with SSE still offline, your app is now much more reliable for the live match flow, thanks to the aggressive polling and fallback mechanisms:
Immediate Live Screen: The moment ‚ÄúStart Match‚Äù is pressed, the UI switches to the live screen (matchStartRequested triggers it) without waiting on SSE. This worked as expected ‚Äì the logs show ‚úÖ Match start requested - showing live screen immediately. So there‚Äôs no more 8-10 second delay for the user.
Polling Kicking In: Within 1-2 seconds, the fallback polling begins updating the timer. The logs üìä Polling: Timer updated - ... confirm the timer ticks are driven by polling. The match status in the UI flipped to LIVE almost immediately after start (Match state updated: {... "status": "LIVE"} in logs), because the code fetched match details right after starting the match. The timer then progresses via polling every 2 seconds.
Multiple Fallback Layers: Your implementation has numerous safeguards (health checks, manual triggers) that ensure the timer keeps running even if SSE is down. For example, the health check effect detects a stalled connection after 3 seconds and calls startPollingFallback()
GitHub
. This is clearly functioning ‚Äì the initial connectionStatus switched to "disconnected" and polling took over almost instantly.
No Single Point of Failure: By not depending on SSE, the system now relies on simple periodic GET requests. HTTP polling is very robust across different network conditions and devices. It may not be as real-time as SSE in theory, but a 2-second interval is acceptable for a match clock and greatly reduces the chance of a total failure. In other words, the user will always see the timer, even if it updates in 2-second jumps.
Is this reliable? Yes, for the core need of showing the live timer, the polling-first architecture is reliable. The user experience is vastly improved ‚Äì you‚Äôve essentially removed the risk that the timer never starts. The only minor drawback is that the timer is updating every 2 seconds instead of every 1 second (and without the smooth per-second interpolation that SSE mode would have provided). If a two-second jump in the clock is a concern, you could consider tightening the poll interval to 1 second, but keep an eye on API load. For now, 2s polling with a snappy initial response is a huge improvement in reliability over waiting for SSE.
üöÄ Next Steps: Enabling SSE (Optional but Beneficial)
While your fallback works, you likely still want SSE to function for the best real-time experience (and to reduce network calls). Here‚Äôs what to do:
Fix the Polyfill Import: Update the polyfill setup to properly assign the EventSource. For example, implement the snippet from the migration guide in your App.tsx (before rendering the app):
ts
Copy
import RNEventSource from 'react-native-event-source';
global.EventSource = RNEventSource;
Remove or adjust the require('...').EventSource logic accordingly. This change will ensure that typeof EventSource !== 'undefined' on app launch, and your test button will confirm it.
Retest SSE Connection: After fixing and redeploying, use the Test SSE Connection button again. You should see logs like ‚Äúüîç EventSource type: object/function‚Äù and no ‚Äúnot available‚Äù error. The status might go to "Connecting..." and ideally "Connected" if the /sse/test endpoint is reachable. (Make sure your /api/sse/test endpoint is still running on Railway ‚Äì it likely is, since your server-side SSE was confirmed working via curl earlier.)
Observe useMatchTimer Behavior: With a working EventSource, the useMatchTimer hook will attempt to connect via SSE when the live screen mounts. A successful connection should log ‚úÖ SSE: Connection established successfully!
GitHub
 and start streaming timer updates every second. The polling fallback will still be there as a safety net, but ideally the SSE will take over:
If SSE connects quickly (within ~2s), the backup polling might never kick in. The hook checks timerState.connectionStatus before starting polling after 2s
GitHub
. Once SSE is connected (connectionStatus: 'connected'), the polling timeout won‚Äôt trigger.
You‚Äôll get smoother timer updates (the code even does a 100ms interval update for smooth seconds
GitHub
 when SSE is feeding data).
All other events (like goals or halftime) can also be pushed instantly via SSE in the future, rather than waiting for the next poll.
Verify End-to-End: Do a full match test: start match, let it run a few minutes, maybe simulate a goal (if that triggers an SSE message or at least a score change in DB) to ensure the UI reflects it. Check that the timer transitions to halftime and fulltime correctly. With SSE active, the app should handle these in real-time. The polling will automatically stop when the match status is no longer LIVE (as seen in logs: Match no longer live, stopping polling came when you ended the match)
GitHub
.
If for some reason SSE still does not connect even after the polyfill fix (which it should on a real device or simulator), you still have a rock-solid fallback. The app is usable and reliable. In production, having both mechanisms isn‚Äôt a bad thing ‚Äì SSE can be an enhancement, and polling ensures nothing breaks if SSE fails.
üîÑ Conclusion: Current Status and Confidence
You‚Äôve effectively resolved the critical issue ‚Äì the live screen now shows up promptly and the timer runs. The solution is robust due to multiple fallback layers. The remaining task is mostly cleanup/improvement: fixing the polyfill so that SSE can operate as intended. This will give you the best of both worlds: real-time updates when possible, and automatic polling if anything goes wrong. Even if SSE weren‚Äôt enabled, the system would still be highly reliable (it‚Äôs essentially how many production apps handle live data when push mechanisms fail). But given you‚Äôve already implemented SSE on the backend, it‚Äôs worth enabling on the client for finer-grained updates. Key takeaways going forward:
Double-check integration of any third-party polyfills or libraries in React Native. As we saw, a small import detail (.EventSource vs default export) can silently break functionality.
Keep those fallback mechanisms in place; they proved invaluable. Even once SSE works, you might keep polling as a secondary channel (maybe at a slower interval or only as a check) to catch any missed updates or reconnection issues.
Test on real devices if possible, since React Native networking can occasionally behave differently on Android vs iOS vs Emulators. But the approach you have is solid.
Once you adjust the polyfill and confirm SSE is working (watch for that ‚Äú‚úÖ SSE: Connection established‚Äù log and the absence of ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù status), you should have full confidence in the live match screen‚Äôs reliability. Great job on implementing the fixes ‚Äì you‚Äôve turned a show-stopping bug into a resilient, multi-layered solution! üéâ
