# Timer Synchronization Implementation

## Problem Solved
Match cards (MatchesScreen) and match screens (MatchScoringScreen) were showing different timer values because they used different calculation methods.

## Solution: Shared Timer Utility

### Created `src/utils/matchTimer.ts`
- **Single source of truth** for all timer calculations
- **Consistent logic** between match cards and match screens
- **Handles all scenarios**: SSE connected, SSE disconnected, first half, second half, halftime

### Updated Components

#### 1. ProfessionalMatchCard.tsx
**Before**: Used custom timer logic with potential inconsistencies
```typescript
// Old logic had complex half-time calculations that could differ
const currentHalf = (match as any).current_half || 1;
// ... complex calculations
```

**After**: Uses shared utility
```typescript
const timerResult = calculateMatchTimer({ match: match as any });
return timerResult.displayText;
```

#### 2. MatchScoringScreen.tsx
**Before**: Had its own `getCurrentTimerValues()` function
**After**: Uses shared `calculateMatchTimer()` utility

#### 3. MatchesScreen.tsx
**Before**: Updated timers every 60 seconds (1 minute)
**After**: Updates every 1 second for live matches using shared utility

## Key Features

### Consistent Timer Display
- **5-min match**: 0:00 → 2:30 (halftime) → 2:30 → 5:00
- **90-min match**: 0:00 → 45:00 (halftime) → 45:00 → 90:00
- **Same formatting**: "45'", "45+2'", "HT", "FT"

### Real-time Updates
- Match cards update every second when live matches exist
- Uses `timer_started_at` for accurate timing (not `match_date`)
- Handles second half properly (starts from duration/2)

### Fallback Logic
- **SSE connected**: Uses real-time SSE data
- **SSE disconnected**: Uses calculated values from database timestamps
- **Consistent behavior** regardless of connection type

## Files Modified
1. `/football-app/src/utils/matchTimer.ts` (NEW)
2. `/football-app/src/components/professional/ProfessionalMatchCard.tsx`
3. `/football-app/src/screens/matches/MatchScoringScreen.tsx`
4. `/football-app/src/screens/main/MatchesScreen.tsx`

## Testing Required
1. **Start a 5-minute match**
2. **Check MatchesScreen**: Timer should show same value as inside match
3. **Verify real-time updates**: Both should update every second
4. **Test halftime**: Both should show "HT" at same time
5. **Test second half**: Both should start from 2:30

## Expected Result
**Perfect synchronization** between match card timers and actual match screen timers using the same calculation logic and update frequency.
