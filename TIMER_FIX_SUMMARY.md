# Timer Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The live match timer wasn't updating visually because of a race condition in the Global Timer Manager initialization. The timer would work after a rebuild because the async feature flag loading would complete before navigation.

## Root Causes
1. **Race Condition**: The timer manager was initialized with `isEnabled: false` and used async import to load feature flags
2. **Subscription Issue**: The `useMatchTimerFromGlobal` hook wasn't properly subscribing to Zustand state changes
3. **Timer Not Starting**: Even when matches were added, the interval wouldn't start if `isEnabled` was still false

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Race Condition in Timer Initialization
**File**: `globalMatchTimerManager.ts`
- Changed from async `import()` to synchronous `require()` for feature flags
- Ensures timer manager is enabled immediately on app start

### 2. Fixed Zustand Subscription
**File**: `globalMatchTimerManager.ts`
- Updated `useMatchTimerFromGlobal` hook to properly subscribe to state changes
- Now returns the match data directly to trigger re-renders when timer updates

### 3. Enhanced Timer Starting Logic
**File**: `MatchScoringScreenSSE.tsx`
- Added force start logic when loading live match data
- Improved timer state management and debugging

### 4. Improved Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging to track timer updates
- Added useEffect to log timer changes in live match screen

## How the Timer System Works Now

1. **App Start**: Timer manager is initialized synchronously with feature flag
2. **Match Load**: When a live match is loaded, it's added to the global timer
3. **Timer Updates**: Single interval updates all live matches every second
4. **Component Updates**: Zustand subscription triggers re-renders in components
5. **Display**: Timer shows accurate time with smooth updates

## Testing Instructions

1. Start a new match
2. Navigate to the live match screen
3. Timer should immediately start counting
4. Navigate back and forth - timer should continue running
5. Timer should update every second without needing navigation

## Additional Notes

- The Global Timer Manager is designed to handle 500+ simultaneous matches
- Uses a single interval for all matches (performance optimization)
- Works offline with client-side calculations
- Automatically cleans up when matches end
