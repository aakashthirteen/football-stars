current issues - where the fuck everything went? I am not able to load anything on the app, nothing is loading. stats are showing all 0 on homescreen after correcting this please come to the following list and i am using railway postgres for backend fyi 1. after ending a live match there were two more steps. first rating all your team players and second the summary of the match that we often see in a finished match. both are gone. 2. in live match i had tabs like actions - there i will actions or event i need to make, then second tab formation third tab commentary forth tab match events just like Google does for live football matches - that is also gone. 3. The pitch looks fine but it should be half divided between both teams and it should be dynamically and symmetrically arranged. for e.g. my team have 2 mid fielders but in your UI they are above each other i can just see one, so it should be dynamically manageable and should have symmetry in its own half for one team. if add one more mid fielders then 3 midfielders should be able to adjust them accordingly.

Edit
I understand your frustration! Let me help fix these critical issues. First, let's diagnose why nothing is loading and then address each of your concerns.

ðŸš¨ Immediate Issue: Nothing Loading
Let me check the API connection and see what's happening:


read_file
I see the issue! The API is set to USE_MOCK = false but it's trying to connect to your Railway backend. Let me check if there are any connection issues:


read_file
Now let me check the recent changes to see what might have broken. Let me look at the match rating and summary screens that are missing:


search_files

search_files
Let me check the navigation file to see what screens are registered:


search_files

list_directory

list_directory
Let me check if the PlayerRatingScreen and MatchSummaryScreen exist:


search_files

list_directory
I see! The PlayerRatingScreen and MatchSummaryScreen files are missing! Let me create them. First, let me check the MatchesStack to see how they should be registered:


read_file
Now let me create the missing PlayerRatingScreen:


write_file
Now let me create the MatchSummaryScreen:


write_file
Now I need to register these screens in the navigation. Let me update the MatchesStack:


edit_file
Now I need to update the MatchScoringScreen to navigate to PlayerRatingScreen when the match ends. Let me check the endMatch function:


edit_file
Now let me address the issue about nothing loading. It seems the API might not be connecting properly. Let me check if there's a connection issue with the Railway backend. First, let me see if the stats calculation on the home screen is working properly:


edit_file
Now let me check the HomeScreen stats calculation to fix the issue there as well:


edit_file
Now let me create the missing tabs functionality for the live match. Let me create a new modern MatchScoringScreen with tabs:
