# ACTUAL Timer Fix - Root Cause Found & Fixed

## The Real Problem

After analyzing the logs, I discovered there are **TWO** timer services:
1. `globalMatchTimerManager.ts` (Zustand-based) - Not being used
2. `GlobalTimerService.ts` (Event-based) - **This is the active one**

## Root Cause

In `GlobalTimerService.ts` line 123:
```typescript
let displayMinute = Math.ceil(totalElapsedSeconds / 60); // ❌ WRONG!
```

**The issue**: `Math.ceil()` rounds UP, so:
- At 1 second: `Math.ceil(1/60) = Math.ceil(0.0167) = 1` → Shows **1:00**
- At 59 seconds: `Math.ceil(59/60) = Math.ceil(0.983) = 1` → Shows **1:00**

This made the timer **start at 1:00 instead of 0:00**.

## Fix Applied

Changed `Math.ceil()` to `Math.floor()`:
```typescript
let displayMinute = Math.floor(totalElapsedSeconds / 60); // ✅ CORRECT!
```

Now:
- At 0 seconds: `Math.floor(0/60) = 0` → Shows **0:00**
- At 59 seconds: `Math.floor(59/60) = 0` → Shows **0:59**
- At 60 seconds: `Math.floor(60/60) = 1` → Shows **1:00**

## Display Logic for Match Cards

Added proper ceiling logic for match cards as requested:
```typescript
// For match cards: show ceiling of minutes (1' for 0:10, 3' for 2:34)
let displayMinuteForCard = displayMinute;
if (displaySecond > 0 && displayMinute < timerData.duration) {
  displayMinuteForCard = displayMinute + 1;
}
// Handle start of match: 0:00 should show 0'
if (totalElapsedSeconds === 0) {
  displayMinuteForCard = 0;
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Live Match Screen
- Shows exact time: 0:00, 0:01, 0:59, 1:00, 2:34

### Match Cards  
- 0:00 → Shows 0'
- 0:01-0:59 → Shows 1' (going towards minute 1)
- 1:00-1:59 → Shows 2' (going towards minute 2)
- 2:00-2:59 → Shows 3' (going towards minute 3)

## Files Changed
- `src/services/GlobalTimerService.ts` - Fixed timer calculation logic

## Why My Previous Attempts Failed
I was fixing the wrong timer service! The logs clearly showed `GlobalTimerService.ts` was active, but I was working on `globalMatchTimerManager.ts` which isn't being used.
