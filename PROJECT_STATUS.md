2. **State Management (useState)** - ‚úÖ REBUILT & WORKING 
3. **API Calls (useEffect + loadMatchDetails)** - ‚úÖ REBUILT & WORKING
4. **Event Handlers (addEvent, addGoalWithAssist)** - ‚úÖ REBUILT & WORKING
5. **Animation Refs and Functions** - ‚úÖ REBUILT & WORKING
6. **Complex Conditional Rendering** - ‚úÖ REBUILT & WORKING
7. **Professional UI Layout & Styling** - ‚úÖ REBUILT & WORKING
8. **Multiple Map Operations** - ‚úÖ ALL WORKING
9. **Modal Workflows** - ‚úÖ REBUILT & WORKING

### **üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**

- **Correct state initialization** preventing race conditions
- **Fixed color theme references** that were causing runtime errors
- **Improved error handling** in all map operations

### **üí° KEY SUCCESS FACTORS:**
- Methodical step-by-step rebuilding
- Comprehensive testing at each stage  
- Proper TypeScript error handling
- Theme integration fixes
