- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Connected PlayerRatingScreen to backend with immediate saves
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Added defensive SQL queries to prevent 500 errors (commit 54c001a)
- **‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE**: 500 Internal Server Error still occurring - needs Railway deployment verification

**DEFENSIVE FIXES IMPLEMENTED (commit 54c001a):**
- Made `getPlayerStats()` defensive - separates rating query with try-catch
- Made `getAllPlayersStats()` defensive - splits base stats and ratings with error handling  
- Returns 0 rating if `player_ratings` table doesn't exist instead of crashing
- Should prevent 500 errors during deployment when database is in intermediate state

**STATUS**: Defensive fix committed but needs Railway deployment to take effect
