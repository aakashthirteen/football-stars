# Football Stars App - Current Status

**Last Updated:** June 17, 2025  
**Status:** üö® **CRITICAL: HEADER CONSISTENCY ISSUE - NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**

---

## üö® **CRITICAL PRIORITY FOR NEXT SESSION**

### **HEADER SEPARATOR LINE INCONSISTENCY**
**PROBLEM:** The visual separator line at the bottom of headers appears at different vertical positions across screens
- **Teams Screen**: Line position differs from other screens
- **Matches Screen**: Different line position 
- **Tournaments Screen**: Different line position with biggest gap

**ROOT CAUSE:** Even with same header height (180px), the subtitle content takes different amounts of space, causing the visual separator to appear at different levels relative to text.

**CURRENT STATUS:** 
- ‚ùå Header heights are now consistent (180px for all subtitle screens)
- ‚ùå But visual separator line still appears at different positions
- ‚ùå User frustrated with inconsistent UI across screens

**REQUIRED FIX:** Make the distance from top of screen to content separator line EXACTLY the same across all three screens (Teams, Matches, Tournaments).

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Debug exactly why separator line positions differ
2. Ensure consistent visual layout across all screens
3. Test on actual device to verify fix works
4. **PRIORITY: COMPLETE THIS BEFORE ANY OTHER TASKS**
